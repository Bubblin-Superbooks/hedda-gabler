post.</p><p>BERTA. [Taking the letter.] Yes, ma'am.</p><p>[She opens the door for JUDGE BRACK and goes out herself.  Brack
is a main of forty-five; thick set, but well-built and elastic
in his movements.  His face is roundish with an aristocratic
profile.  His hair is short, still almost black, and carefully
dressed.  His eyebrows thick.  His moustaches are also thick,
with short-cut ends.  He wears a well-cut walking-suit, a
little too youthful for his age.  He uses an eye-glass, which
he now and then lets drop.</p><p>JUDGE BRACK.</p></div> </div>
