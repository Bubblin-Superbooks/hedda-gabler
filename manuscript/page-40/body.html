Berta—why have you done this? Taken the chintz covers off all the
furniture.</p><p>BERTA.</p><p>The mistress told me to. She can't abide covers on the chairs, she says.</p><p>MISS TESMAN.</p><p>Are they going to make this their everyday sitting-room then?</p><p>BERTA.</p><p>Yes, that's what I understood—from the mistress. Master George—the
doctor—he said nothing.</p><p>GEORGE TESMAN comes from the right into the inner room,
humming to himself, and carrying an unstrapped empty
portmanteau.  He is a middle-sized, young-looking man of
thirty-three, rather stout, with a round, open, cheerful
face, fair hair and beard.  He wears spectacles, and is
somewhat carelessly dressed in comfortable indoor clothes.</p></div> </div>
