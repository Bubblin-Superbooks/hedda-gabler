piano has been removed, and an elegant little writing-table
with the book-shelves put in its place.  A smaller table
stands near the sofa on the left.  Most of the bouquets have
been taken away.  MRS. ELVSTED'S bouquet is upon the large
table in front.â€”It is afternoon.</p><p>HEDDA, dressed to receive callers, is alone in the room. She
stands by the open glass door, loading a revolver.  The
fellow to it lies in an open pistol-case on the writing-
table.</p></div> </div>
