<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">BERTA, who carries a
bouquet wrapped in paper.  MISS TESMAN is a comely and pleasant-
looking lady of about sixty-five.  She is nicely but simply
dressed in a grey walking-costume.  BERTA is a middle-aged
woman of plain and rather countrified appearance.</p><p>MISS TESMAN.</p><p>[Stops close to the door, listens, and says softly:] Upon my word, I
don't believe they are stirring yet!</p><p>BERTA.</p><p>[Also softly.] I told you so, Miss. Remember how late the steamboat got
in last night. And then, when they got home!—good Lord, what a lot the
young mistress had to unpack before she could get to bed.</p><p>MISS TESMAN.</p><p>Well well—let them have their sleep out. But let us see that they get a
good breath of the fresh morning air when they do appear.</p><p>[She goes to the glass door and throws it open.]</p></div> </div>
