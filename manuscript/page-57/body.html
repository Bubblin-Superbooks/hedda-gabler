George.</p><p>TESMAN.</p><p>[Embracing her.] Oh yes, yes, Aunt Julia! Hedda—she is the best part of
it all! I believe I hear her coming—eh?</p><p>HEDDA enters from the left through the inner room.  Her face
and figure show refinement and distinction.  Her complexion
is pale and opaque.  Her steel-grey eyes express a cold,
unruffled repose.  Her hair is of an agreeable brown, but
not particularly abundant.  She is dressed in a tasteful,
somewhat loose-fitting morning gown.</p><p>MISS TESMAN.</p><p>[Going to meet HEDDA.] Good morning, my dear Hedda! Good morning, and a
hearty welcome!</p></div> </div>
