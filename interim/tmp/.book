  "page-9": "<p>INTRODUCTION.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">From Munich, on June 29, 1890, Ibsen wrote to the Swedish poet, Count\nCarl Soilsky: \"Our intention has all along been to spend the summer in\nthe Tyrol again. But circumstances are against our doing so. I am at\npresent engaged upon a new dramatic work, which for several reasons has\nmade very slow progress, and I do not leave Munich until I can take with\nme the completed first draft. There is little or no prospect of my being\nable to complete it in July.\" Ibsen did not leave Munich at all that\nseason. On October 30 he wrote: \"At present I am utterly engrossed in\na new play. Not one leisure hour have I had for several months.\" Three\nweeks later (November 20) he wrote to his French translator, Count\nProzor: \"My new play is finished; the manuscript went off to Copenhagen\nthe day before yesterday.... It produces a curious feeling of emptiness\nto be thus suddenly separated from a work which has</p>",
  "page-10": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">occupied one's time\nand thoughts for several months, to the exclusion of all else. But it is\na good thing, too, to have done with it. The constant intercourse with\nthe fictitious personages was beginning to make me quite nervous.\" To\nthe same correspondent he wrote on December 4: \"The title of the play is\n<em>Hedda Gabler</em>. My intention in giving it this name was to indicate\nthat Hedda, as a personality, is to be regarded rather as her father's\ndaughter than as her husband's wife. It was not my desire to deal in\nthis play with so-called problems. What I principally wanted to do was\nto depict human beings, human emotions, and human destinies, upon a\ngroundwork of certain of the social conditions and principles of the\npresent day.\"</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">So far we read the history of the play in the official\n\"Correspondence.\"(1) Some interesting glimpses into the poet's moods\nduring the period between the completion of <em>The Lady from the Sea</em>\nand the</p>",
  "page-11": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">publication of <em>Hedda Gabler</em> are to be found in the series of\nletters to Fraulein Emilie Bardach, of Vienna, published by Dr. George\nBrandes.(2) This young lady Ibsen met at Gossensass in the Tyrol in\nthe autumn of 1889. The record of their brief friendship belongs to the\nhistory of <em>The Master Builder</em> rather than to that of <em>Hedda Gabler</em>,\nbut the allusions to his work in his letters to her during the winter of\n1889 demand some examination.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">So early as October 7, 1889, he writes to her: \"A new poem begins to\ndawn in me. I will execute it this winter, and try to transfer to it\nthe bright atmosphere of the summer. But I feel that it will end in\nsadness—such is my nature.\" Was this \"dawning\" poem <em>Hedda Gabler</em>? Or\nwas it rather <em>The Master Builder</em> that was germinating in his mind? Who\nshall say? The latter hypothesis seems the more probable, for it is hard\nto believe that at any stage in the incubation of <em>Hedda</em></p>",
  "page-12": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \"><em>Gabler</em> he can\nhave conceived it as even beginning in gaiety. A week later, however,\nhe appears to have made up his mind that the time had not come for the\npoetic utilisation of his recent experiences. He writes on October 15:\n\"Here I sit as usual at my writing-table. Now I would fain work, but\nam unable to. My fancy, indeed, is very active. But it always wanders\naway ours. I cannot repress my summer memories—nor do I wish to. I live\nthrough my experience again and again and yet again. To transmute it\nall into a poem, I find, in the meantime, impossible.\" Clearly, then,\nhe felt that his imagination ought to have been engaged on some theme\nhaving no relation to his summer experiences—the theme, no doubt, of\n<em>Hedda Gabler</em>. In his next letter, dated October 29, he writes: \"Do not\nbe troubled because I cannot, in the meantime, create (<em>dichten</em>). In\nreality I am for ever creating, or, at any rate, dreaming of something\nwhich, when in the fulness of time it ripens,</p>",
  "page-13": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">will reveal itself as\na creation (<em>Dichtung</em>).\" On November 19 he says: \"I am very busily\noccupied with preparations for my new poem. I sit almost the whole day\nat my writing-table. Go out only in the evening for a little while.\" The\nfive following letters contain no allusion to the play; but on September\n18, 1890, he wrote: \"My wife and son are at present at Riva, on the Lake\nof Garda, and will probably remain there until the middle of October,\nor even longer. Thus I am quite alone here, and cannot get away. The new\nplay on which I am at present engaged will probably not be ready until\nNovember, though I sit at my writing-table daily, and almost the whole\nday long.\"</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Here ends the history of <em>Hedda Gabler</em>, so far as the poet's\nletters carry us. Its hard clear outlines, and perhaps somewhat bleak\natmosphere, seem to have resulted from a sort of reaction against the\nsentimental \"dreamery\" begotten of his Gossensass experiences.</p>",
  "page-14": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">He\nsought refuge in the chill materialism of Hedda from the ardent\ntranscendentalism of Hilda, whom he already heard knocking at the door.\nHe was not yet in the mood to deal with her on the plane of poetry.(3)</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \"><em>Hedda Gabler</em> was published in Copenhagen on December 16, 1890. This\nwas the first of Ibsen's plays to be translated from proof-sheets and\npublished in England and America almost simultaneously with its first\nappearance in Scandinavia. The earliest theatrical performance took\nplace at the Residenz Theater, Munich, on the last day of January 1891,\nin the presence of the poet, Frau Conrad-Ramlo playing the title-part.\nThe Lessing Theater, Berlin, followed suit on February 10. Not till\nFebruary 25 was the play seen in Copenhagen, with Fru Hennings as Hedda.\nOn the following night it was given for the first time in Christiania,\nthe Norwegian Hedda being Froken Constance Bruun. It was this production\nwhich the</p>",
  "page-15": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">poet saw when he visited the Christiania Theater for the first\ntime after his return to Norway, August 28, 1891. It would take pages\nto give even the baldest list of the productions and revivals of <em>Hedda\nGabler</em> in Scandinavia and Germany, where it has always ranked among\nIbsen's most popular works. The admirable production of the play by Miss\nElizabeth Robins and Miss Marion Lea, at the Vaudeville Theatre,\nLondon, April 20, 1891, may rank as the second great step towards\nthe popularisation of Ibsen in England, the first being the\nCharrington-Achurch production of <em>A Doll's House</em> in 1889. Miss Robins\nafterwards repeated her fine performance of Hedda many times, in London,\nin the English provinces, and in New York. The character has also been\nacted in London by Eleonora Duse, and as I write (March, 5, 1907) by\nMrs. Patrick Campbell, at the Court Theatre. In Australia and America,\nHedda has frequently been acted by Miss</p>",
  "page-16": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">Nance O'Neill and other\nactresses—quite recently by a Russian actress, Madame Alla Nazimova,\nwho (playing in English) seems to have made a notable success both in\nthis part and in Nora. The first French Hedda Gabler was Mlle. Marthe\nBrandes, who played the part at the Vaudeville Theatre, Paris, on\nDecember 17, 1891, the performance being introduced by a lecture by M.\nJules Lemaitre. In Holland, in Italy, in Russia, the play has been acted\ntimes without number. In short (as might easily have been foretold) it\nhas rivalled <em>A Doll's House</em> in world-wide popularity.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">It has been suggested,(4) I think without sufficient ground, that Ibsen\ndeliberately conceived <em>Hedda Gabler</em> as an \"international\" play, and\nthat the scene is really the \"west end\" of any European city. To me\nit seems quite clear that Ibsen had Christiania in mind, and the\nChristiania of a somewhat earlier period than the 'nineties. The\nelectric cars, telephones, and other</p>",
  "page-17": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">conspicuous factors in the life of\na modern capital are notably absent from the play. There is no electric\nlight in Secretary Falk's villa. It is still the habit for ladies to\nreturn on foot from evening parties, with gallant swains escorting them.\nThis \"suburbanism,\" which so distressed the London critics of 1891,\nwas characteristic of the Christiania Ibsen himself had known in the\n'sixties—the Christiania of _Love's Comedy_—rather than of the\ngreatly extended and modernised city of the end of the century. Moreover\nLovborg's allusions to the fiord, and the suggested picture of Sheriff\nElvsted, his family and his avocations are all distinctively Norwegian.\nThe truth seems to be very simple—the environment and the subsidiary\npersonages are all thoroughly national, but Hedda herself is an\n\"international\" type, a product of civilisation by no means peculiar to\nNorway.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">We cannot point to any individual model or models</p>",
  "page-18": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">who \"sat to\" Ibsen for\nthe character of Hedda.(5) The late Grant Allen declared that Hedda was\n\"nothing more nor less than the girl we take down to dinner in London\nnineteen times out of twenty\"; in which case Ibsen must have suffered\nfrom a superfluidity of models, rather than from any difficulty in\nfinding one. But the fact is that in this, as in all other instances,\nthe word \"model\" must be taken in a very different sense from that in\nwhich it is commonly used in painting. Ibsen undoubtedly used models for\nthis trait and that, but never for a whole figure. If his characters can\nbe called portraits at all, they are composite portraits. Even when it\nseems pretty clear that the initial impulse towards the creation of a\nparticular character came from some individual, the original figure is\nentirely transmuted in the process of harmonisation with the dramatic\nscheme. We need not, therefore, look for a definite prototype of Hedda;\nbut Dr. Brandes shows</p>",
  "page-19": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">that two of that lady's exploits were probably\nsuggested by the anecdotic history of the day.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Ibsen had no doubt heard how the wife of a well-known Norwegian\ncomposer, in a fit of raging jealousy excited by her husband's prolonged\nabsence from home, burnt the manuscript of a symphony which he had just\nfinished. The circumstances under which Hedda burns Lovborg's manuscript\nare, of course, entirely different and infinitely more dramatic;\nbut here we have merely another instance of the dramatisation or\n\"poetisation\" of the raw material of life. Again, a still more painful\nincident probably came to his knowledge about the same time. A beautiful\nand very intellectual woman was married to a well-known man who had been\naddicted to drink, but had entirely conquered the vice. One day a mad\nwhim seized her to put his self-mastery and her power over him to the\ntest. As it happened to be his birthday, she rolled into his study a\nsmall keg of brandy,</p>",
  "page-20": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">and then withdrew. She returned some time after\nwards to find that he had broached the keg, and lay insensible on the\nfloor. In this anecdote we cannot but recognise the germ, not only of\nHedda's temptation of Lovborg, but of a large part of her character.</p><p>\"Thus,\" says Dr. Brandes, \"out of small and scattered traits of reality\nIbsen fashioned his close-knit and profoundly thought-out works of art.\"</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">For the character of Eilert Lovborg, again, Ibsen seem unquestionably\nto have borrowed several traits from a definite original. A young Danish\nman of letters, whom Dr. Brandes calls Holm, was an enthusiastic admirer\nof Ibsen, and came to be on very friendly terms with him. One day Ibsen\nwas astonished to receive, in Munich, a parcel addressed from Berlin by\nthis young man, containing, without a word of explanation, a packet of\nhis (Ibsen's) letters, and a photograph which he had presented to Holm.\nIbsen brooded and brooded</p>",
  "page-21": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">over the incident, and at last came to the\nconclusion that the young man had intended to return her letters and\nphotograph to a young lady to whom he was known to be attached, and had\nin a fit of aberration mixed up the two objects of his worship. Some\ntime after, Holm appeared at Ibsen's rooms. He talked quite rationally,\nbut professed to have no knowledge whatever of the letter-incident,\nthough he admitted the truth of Ibsen's conjecture that the \"belle dame\nsans merci\" had demanded the return of her letters and portrait. Ibsen\nwas determined to get at the root of the mystery; and a little inquiry\ninto his young friend's habits revealed the fact that he broke his fast\non a bottle of port wine, consumed a bottle of Rhine wine at lunch, of\nBurgundy at dinner, and finished off the evening with one or two more\nbottles of port. Then he heard, too, how, in the course of a night's\ncarouse, Holm had lost the manuscript of a book; and in these traits he\nsaw the</p>",
  "page-22": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">outline of the figure of Eilert Lovborg.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Some time elapsed, and again Ibsen received a postal packet from Holm.\nThis one contained his will, in which Ibsen figured as his residuary\nlegatee. But many other legatees were mentioned in the instrument—all\nof them ladies, such as Fraulein Alma Rothbart, of Bremen, and Fraulein\nElise Kraushaar, of Berlin. The bequests to these meritorious spinsters\nwere so generous that their sum considerably exceeded the amount of\nthe testator's property. Ibsen gently but firmly declined the proffered\ninheritance; but Holm's will no doubt suggested to him the figure of\nthat red-haired \"Mademoiselle Diana,\" who is heard of but not seen\nin <em>Hedda Gabler</em>, and enabled him to add some further traits to the\nportraiture of Lovborg. When the play appeared, Holm recognised\nhimself with glee in the character of the bibulous man of letters,\nand thereafter adopted \"Eilert Lovborg\" as his pseudonym. I do</p>",
  "page-23": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">not,\ntherefore, see why Dr. Brandes should suppress his real name; but I\nwillingly imitate him in erring on the side of discretion. The poor\nfellow died several years ago.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Some critics have been greatly troubled as to the precise meaning of\nHedda's fantastic vision of Lovborg \"with vine-leaves in his hair.\"\nSurely this is a very obvious image or symbol of the beautiful, the\nideal, aspect of bacchic elation and revelry. Antique art, or I am much\nmistaken, shows us many figures of Dionysus himself and his followers\nwith vine-leaves entwined their hair. To Ibsen's mind, at any rate, the\nimage had long been familiar. In <em>Peer Gynt</em> (Act iv. sc. 8), when Peer,\nhaving carried off Anitra, finds himself in a particularly festive mood,\nhe cries: \"Were there vine-leaves around, I would garland my brow.\"\nAgain, in <em>Emperor and Galilean</em> (Pt. ii. Act 1) where Julian, in the\nprocession of Dionysus, impersonates the god</p>",
  "page-24": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">himself, it is directed\nthat he shall wear a wreath of vine-leaves. Professor Dietrichson\nrelates that among the young artists whose society Ibsen frequented\nduring his first years in Rome, it was customary, at their little\nfestivals, for the revellers to deck themselves in this fashion. But the\nimage is so obvious that there is no need to trace it to any personal\nexperience. The attempt to place Hedda's vine-leaves among Ibsen's\nobscurities is an example of the firm resolution not to understand which\nanimated the criticism of the 'nineties.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Dr. Brandes has dealt very severely with the character of Eilert\nLovborg, alleging that we cannot believe in the genius attributed to\nhim. But where is he described as a genius? The poet represents him as a\nvery able student of sociology; but that is quite a different thing from\nattributing to him such genius as must necessarily shine forth in every\nword he utters. Dr. Brandes, indeed, declines to believe even in his\nability as</p>",
  "page-25": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">a sociologist, on the ground that it is idle to write about\nthe social development of the future. \"To our prosaic minds,\" he says,\n\"it may seem as if the most sensible utterance on the subject is that of\nthe fool of the play: 'The future! Good heavens, we know nothing of the\nfuture.'\" The best retort to this criticism is that which Eilert himself\nmakes: \"There's a thing or two to be said about it all the same.\" The\nintelligent forecasting of the future (as Mr. H. G. Wells has shown)\nis not only clearly distinguishable from fantastic Utopianism, but is\nindispensable to any large statesmanship or enlightened social activity.\nWith very real and very great respect for Dr. Brandes, I cannot think\nthat he has been fortunate in his treatment of Lovborg's character.\nIt has been represented as an absurdity that he would think of reading\nabstracts from his new book to a man like Tesman, whom he despises. But\nthough Tesman is a ninny, he is, as Hedda says, a \"specialist\"—he is</p>",
  "page-26": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">a\ncompetent, plodding student of his subject. Lovborg may quite naturally\nwish to see how his new method, or his excursion into a new field,\nstrikes the average scholar of the Tesman type. He is, in fact, \"trying\nit on the dog\"—neither an unreasonable nor an unusual proceeding. There\nis, no doubt, a certain improbability in the way in which Lovborg is\nrepresented as carrying his manuscript around, and especially in Mrs.\nElvsted's production of his rough draft from her pocket; but these are\nmechanical trifles, on which only a niggling criticism would dream of\nlaying stress.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Of all Ibsen's works, <em>Hedda Gabler</em> is the most detached, the most\nobjective—a character-study pure and simple. It is impossible—or so\nit seems to me—to extract any sort of general idea from it. One cannot\neven call it a satire, unless one is prepared to apply that term to the\nrecord of a \"case\" in a work of criminology. Reverting to Dumas's dictum\nthat a play should</p>",
  "page-27": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">contain \"a painting, a judgment, an ideal,\" we may\nsay the <em>Hedda Gabler</em> fulfils only the first of these requirements. The\npoet does not even pass judgment on his heroine: he simply paints her\nfull-length portrait with scientific impassivity. But what a portrait!\nHow searching in insight, how brilliant in colouring, how rich in\ndetail! Grant Allen's remark, above quoted, was, of course, a whimsical\nexaggeration; the Hedda type is not so common as all that, else the\nworld would quickly come to an end. But particular traits and tendencies\nof the Hedda type are very common in modern life, and not only among\nwomen. Hyperaesthesia lies at the root of her tragedy. With a keenly\ncritical, relentlessly solvent intelligence, she combines a morbid\nshrinking from all the gross and prosaic detail of the sensual life.\nShe has nothing to take her out of herself—not a single intellectual\ninterest or moral enthusiasm. She cherishes, in a languid way, a petty\nsocial ambition; and even that</p>",
  "page-28": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">she finds obstructed and baffled. At the\nsame time she learns that another woman has had the courage to love and\nventure all, where she, in her cowardice, only hankered and refrained.\nHer malign egoism rises up uncontrolled, and calls to its aid her quick\nand subtle intellect. She ruins the other woman's happiness, but in\ndoing so incurs a danger from which her sense of personal dignity\nrevolts. Life has no such charm for her that she cares to purchase it at\nthe cost of squalid humiliation and self-contempt. The good and the bad\nin her alike impel her to have done with it all; and a pistol-shot\nends what is surely one of the most poignant character-tragedies in\nliterature. Ibsen's brain never worked at higher pressure than in the\nconception and adjustment of those \"crowded hours\" in which Hedda,\ntangled in the web of Will and Circumstance, struggles on till she is\ntoo weary to struggle any more.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">It may not be superfluous to note that the \"a\" in</p>",
